# About Project:

The main objective of this project is to identify various facial emotions like happy,sad,angry,disgust,fear,neutral. We have used Keras and tensorflow libraries to train and test the model and predicted the model performance with the help of Accuracy.

Project execution steps are follows:


The colab file is executed to train and test the model.

The source to extract data is included in the .ipynb file.

Training and visualizing the data

Testing the data

Evaluating model performance

Download the best_model.h5 file after running the .ipynb file and add it to the source folder.

Run the videotester.py file in the command prompt to get the live demo through webcam.
